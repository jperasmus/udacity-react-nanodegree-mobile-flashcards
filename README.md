## Overview

The idea behind this React Native app is to allow a user to add any number of Flashcard decks with their own questions and answers to test themselves with. The application will remind the user to study on a daily basis via a local notification.

## Getting Started

First install all dependencies:

```javascript
yarn;
```

Then, simply start the project:

```javascript
yarn start
```

> If `yarn` is not available, run `npm install && npm start`

## Platforms

This app is an **iOS-only** mobile application and was tested on a physical iPhone SE using Expo.
